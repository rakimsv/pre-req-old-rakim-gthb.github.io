<h3> Who's that?</h3>

<p>This handsome chap to the right is Rakim! (Me.)</p>

<h3>Why Me?</h3>
<p>
I love learning, teaching and always find myself pursuing niches. I discovered Founders & Coders a week ago and in my excitement I've given myself a crash course in basic coding to work on the various pre-requisites and I have really enjoyed it. I'm sure I would have discovered it sooner, had I not been caught up in one of my existing niche hobbies; FIFA Pro Gaming with <a href="http://virtualprogaming.com">VPG</a>. It's a hobby I've been pursuing since January (trust me, I have been gaming a lot longer than that!) and have enjoyed it immensely. I managed my own 25-person squad of players to a championship title within 6 weeks, which included leading and coaching players on the game; I've then taken this success further by becoming one of the league's admins. This means I teach users how to use the site, arrange their fixtures and set an example by being a role model manager and player myself.

<p>I have a passion for Pro Gaming, and would love to use the skills I learn with Founders & Coders to develop my own gaming community, and teach others to use what I know to create their own team's platforms; I want to make FIFA gaming an official Esport by building a slick online platform. Nothing could make that more satisfying than creating it with my own skills and knowledge.
